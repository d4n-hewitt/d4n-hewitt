Hey, I'm Dan and I'm currently a PhD student at UCL working on modelling nanoporous materials for their adsorption properties.  
I use a mix of classical and quantum simulations in order to model zeolites for their potential use in numerous industrial applications.  
I aim to automate most of the file generation, job submission, and data extraction in my job using Python scripts.  
This GitHub is a repository for some of these scripts that might be useful for others or give ideas on how to set up high-throughput workflows.  
I also aim to include some of my ML architectures in coming months.  

# Generate Adsorption Profiles

Generate Adsorption Profiles (GAP) is a tool I've made to allow visualisation of adsorbates in zeolite structures using the output pdb files from RASPA. The **OOP2_GAP.py** script available in the **Adsorption_Profiles** directory can be run in the Movies/System_0 directory of any RASPA calculation where guest molecule positions are printed to the Movie files.
